# Eye Movement

This project takes the x and y coordinates of the mouse curser on a web page and simulates the movement of two eyes to follow the cursor.

How to Run: Fork the repo and keep all files in the same directory. Update the styling, HTML, or JavaScript as needed.

Roadmap of future improvements: background color of the eye exercise.
